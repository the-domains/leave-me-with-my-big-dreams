  Here’s to my friends. You are teachers, police officers, restauranteurs,
  doctors, nurses, therapists, lawyers, hair stylists, photographers,
  triathletes, artists, musicians, engineers (of all kinds), writers, creative
  directors, designers, flight attendants, forensic experts, architects,
  journalists, scientists, bartenders, baristas, comedians, entrepreneurs,
  agents of social change and 307 other things I forget that are equally
  important to this world. Know that I’m proud of you and appreciate all your
  efforts. You make it worth getting up each day.
